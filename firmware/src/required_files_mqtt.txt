If you are not using TLS and the Harmony stack has a sockets like 
interface then there should be a fairly straight forward mapping to the 
secure sockets interface - you can just stub or not implement the TLS part.

These are the components you will need from the Amazon FreeRTOS 
libraries - hope the formatting comes out ok:

Amazon FreeRTOS
   |
   +-lib
       |
       +-mqtt
       |   +-aws_mqtt_lib.c [Required to use library and  agent]
       |   +-aws_mqtt_agent.c   [Required to use the MQTT agent]
       |
       +-include
           |
           +-private              [For internal library use only!]
           |   +-aws_doubly_linked_list.h
           |   +-aws_mqtt_agent_config_defaults.h
           |   +-aws_mqtt_buffer.h
           |   +-aws_mqtt_config_defaults.h
           |   +-aws_mqtt_lib_private.c
           |   +-aws_mqtt_config_defaults.h
           |
           +-aws_mqtt_agent.h    [Include to use the MQTT agent API]
           +-aws_mqtt_lib.h      [Include to use the MQTT library API]
You will also need configuration files that you can pull from the 
existing AWS examples:
aws_mqtt_lib_config.h
aws_mqtt_agent_config.h
aws_bufferpool_config.h
aws_secure_sockets_config.h
